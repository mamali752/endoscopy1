    <h2>What is a gastroscopy?</h2>
       <ul>
            <p><li> Bronchoscopy is a procedure that lets doctors <br>
            look at your lungs and air passages. <br>
        It's usually performed by a doctor who specializes in lung disorders (a pulmonologist).
        </li></p>

         <p><li>Common reasons for needing bronchoscopy are a persistent cough,<br>
             infection or something unusual seen on a chest X-ray or other tes</li></p>
      </ul>
    <h2>Getting ready for the procedure</h2>
    <ul>
    <p><li>You will not be able to eat or drink anything after midnight the night<br>
         before the bronchoscopy. However, your doctor may allow you to take some of your medications.<br>
          Please be sure to ask your physician how to handle your daily medications prior to the procedure.</li></p>
    </ul>
      <h2>The procedure</h2>

      <ul>
             <p><li>Bronchoscopy is usually done in a procedure room in a clinic or in a hospital operating room. <br>
            The entire procedure, including prep and recovery time, typically takes about four hours.<br>
            Bronchoscopy itself usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>During bronchoscopy, the bronchoscope is placed in your nose or mouth. <br>
            The bronchoscope has a light and a very small camera<br>
             at its tip that displays pictures on a monitor to help guide your doctor in performing the procedure.</li></p>
            <p><li>The bronchoscope is advanced slowly down the back of your throat, through the vocal cords and into the airways.<br>
                 It may feel uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. <br>
                 Your health care team will try to make you as comfortable as possible.</li></p>
            <p><li>Samples of tissue and fluid may be taken and procedures may be performed using devices passed through the bronchoscope.<br>
                 Your doctor may ask if you have pain in your chest, <br>
                 back or shoulders. In general, you shouldn't feel pain.</li></p>
        </ul>
     <h2>After the procedure</h2>
        <ul>
             <p><li>You'll be monitored for several hours after bronchoscopy.<br>
                 Your mouth and throat will probably be numb for a couple of hours.<br>
                  You won't be allowed to eat or drink until the numbness wears off.<br>
                   This helps keep food and liquids from entering your airways and lungs.</li></p>
             <p><li>When your mouth and throat are no longer numb,<br>
                 and you're able to swallow and cough normally again,<br>
                  you can have something to drink. Start with sips of water.<br>
                   Then you may eat soft foods, such as soup and applesauce.<br>
                    Add other foods as you feel comfortable.</li></p>
             <p><li>You may have a mild sore throat, hoarseness, a cough or muscle aches.<br>
                 This is normal. Warm water gargles and throat lozenges can help lessen the discomfort.<br>
                  Just be sure all the numbness is gone before you try gargling or sucking on lozenges.</li></p>
