      <h2>What is a gastroscopy?</h2>
      <ul>
         <p><li>A gastroscopy is a test to check inside your throat, food pipe (oesophagus) and stomach,<br>
         known as the upper part of your digestive system.</li></p>
         <p><li>This test can help find what's causing your symptoms.</li></p> 
         <p><li>A long, thin, flexible tube with a small camera inside it is passed into your mouth<br>
           then down your throat and into your stomach.</li></p>
         <p><li>A gastroscopy can also be used to remove tissue for testing (biopsy) and treat<br>
            some conditions such as stomach ulcers.</li></p>
      </ul>
            <h2>Getting ready for the procedure</h2> 
      <ul>
         <p><li>On the day of the gastroscopy, you’ll need to stop eating at least 6 hours before the test.</li></p>
         <p><li>You may be able to have small sips of water. Your letter will give you more details<br>
             about eating and drinking on the day</li></p>
         <p><li>You’ll be offered medicine called sedation to relax you just before a gastroscopy begins.<br>
                 If you choose to have sedation, you’ll need to arrange for someone to collect you after <br>
                 the gastroscopy and take you home.</li></p>
         <p><li>The medicine can stay in the body for around 24 hours, which makes certain activities unsafe,<br>
            such as driving. You will need to arrange for someone to stay with you during this time.</li></p>
      </ul>
