  <h2>Cystoscopy</h2>
  <ul> 
     <li><p><b>A cystoscopy is a procedure to look inside the bladder
        <br>using a thin camera called a cystoscope.</p></b></li>
</ul>
        <img src="./img/cysto.jpg"alt="escope">
<ul>
    <li><p>A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries pee out of the body).</p> 
    <p>and passed into the bladder to allow a doctor or nurse to see inside.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of cystoscopy and how they're carried out</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><p>There are 2 types of cystoscopy:</p></li>
     <li><p><b> flexible cystoscopy –</b> a thin (about the width of a pencil),</p>
     <p>bendy cystoscope is used, and you stay awake while it's carried out</p></li>
     <p><b><li> rigid cystoscopy</b> – a slightly wider cystoscope that does not bend is used</li></p>
    </ul>
<h2>Why cystoscopies are used</h2>
  <ul> 
    <p>A cystoscopy can be used to look for and treat problems in the bladder or urethra.</p>
    <p>For example, it can be used to:</p>
    <p>check for the cause of problems such as <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-in-urine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre">blood in pee</a> , frequent <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-tract-infections-utis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre" > urinary tract infections (UTIs)</a> </p> 
    <p> problems peeing, and long-lasting <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre"> pelvic pain</a> </p>   
    <p>remove a sample of tissue for testing in a laboratory <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/biopsy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre">biopsy</a> </p> 
    <p> to check for problems such as <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bladder-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre"> blood cancer</a> </p>
    <p>carry out treatments, such as removing bladder stones, </p> or removing a stent (a small tube used to treat blockages),</p>
  
  <p> and injecting medicine into the bladder</p>
</ul>
  <h2>Flexible cystoscopy</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>A flexible cystoscopy is where a thin (about the width of a pencil) and bendy cystoscope is used.</p>
    <p>You stay awake while it's carried out.</p></li>
    </ul>
<h2>The procedure</h2>
 <img src="img/flexi.webp" alt="flexible cystoscopy">
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>For a flexible cystoscopy:</b></p></li>
    <li><p>you lie down flat on a special couch</p></li>
    <p><li>your genitals are cleaned with an antiseptic and a sheet is placed over the surrounding area</li></p>
    <p><li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener roreferre"> local anaesthetic</a> is applied to your urethra to numb it</p> <p>and help the cystoscope move along it more easily</li></p> 
    <p><li>the cystoscope is inserted into your urethra and gently moved down towards your bladder</li></p>
    <p><li>water may be pumped into your bladder so your doctor or nurse can see inside it more clearly –</p>
    <p>you may be able to see images sent to a monitor by a camera in the cystoscope</li></p>
</ul>
<h2>Rigid cystoscopy</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>A rigid cystoscopy is where a cystoscope that does not bend is used. You're either put to sleep for the</p>
    <p>procedure or the lower half of your body is numbed while it's carried out.</p></li>
</ul>
    <h2>The procedure</h2>
<img src="img/regi.png" gooo    alt="rigid cystoscopy">
   <p><b>for a rigid cystoscopy:</b></p> 
<ul>
   <p><li>you're given an injection of general anaesthetic (which makes you fall asleep) into your hand,</li></p>
    <p><li>or a spinal anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of your body) into your lower back</li></p>
    <p><li>you will be lying on a special couch with your legs in supports</li></p>   
    <p><li>your genitals are cleaned with an antiseptic and a sheet is placed over the surrounding area</li></p>
    <p><li>the cystoscope is inserted into your urethra and gently moved along towards your bladder</li></p>
     <p>The procedure can last up to 30 minutes.</p>
</ul>
