  <h2>What is a colposcopy?</h2>
    <ul>
     <p><li>A colposcopy is a test to take a closer look at your cervix.</p>
     <p> The cervix is the opening to your womb from your vagina.</li></p>
     <p><li>A colposcopy is often done if cervical screening finds changes to your cells</p>
     <p> that are caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
     <p> changed cells can turn into cervical cancer cells.</li></p>
     <p><li>During a colposcopy a smooth, tube-shaped tool (a speculum)</p>
     <p> is gently placed into your vagina to open it.</p>
     <p> A microscope is then used to look at your cervix in greater detail.</p>
     <p> The microscope stays outside your body.</li></p> 
     <p><li>A small sample of cells may be taken from your cervix for testing.</p><p> This is called a biopsy.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting ready for a colposcopy</h2>
    <p>For the 24 hours before your colposcopy:</p>
    <ul>
        <p><li>do not have penetrative vaginal sex</li></p>
        <p><li>do not use any products that you place inside your vagina,</p> 
        <p> such as tampons, vaginal creams or medicines</li></p>     
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><p>You might have some minor bleeding after the colposcopy, </p></li>
        <p> itâ€™s a good idea to bring a sanitary pad or panty liner to the appointment.</p>
     <Li> <p>If you have a coil (IUD, or Mirena coil),does not usually need to be taken out,</p>
      <p> but tell the person doing the colposcopy that you have one.</p></Li>
    </ul>

     <h2>What happens during a colposcopy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A colposcopy is usually carried out in a hospital or clinic. It should usually</p>
      <p>take 15 to 20 minutes to have your colposcopy and you should be able to go </p>
        <p>afterwards.But you might be at the hospital for several hours</p>
        <p>from getting there to going home.</p></li>

      <li><p>When you arrive at the hospital or clinic, you'll speak with a nurse about </p>
      <p>what's going to happen during the colposcopy.They will ask you</p> 
        <p>some questions about your general health and your medical history.</p></li>
    </ul>
      <h2>The procedure</h2>
    
     <img src="./colp/colp1.png" alt="colonoscopy">
    <ul>
      <p><li>A colposcopy is usually done by a specially trained nurse (colposcopist).</p>
      <p> Sometimes it may be done by a doctor.</li></p>
      <p><li>Before the procedure you will be asked to remove your clothes,</p>
      <p> behind a screen, from the waist down. You may be given a sheet to cover yourself.</li></p>
      <p><li>If you wear a loose skirt or a long jumper,</p>
      <p> you may be able to keep this on during the procedure.</li></p>
      <p><li>You will be asked to lie down and put your legs on a padded support.</li></p>
